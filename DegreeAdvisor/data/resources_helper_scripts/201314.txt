COURSE DESCRIPTIONS 2013-2014
Course Definitions, Designators and Format
Courses approved at the time of publication are listed in this bulletin. Not all courses are offered every term. Refer to the online schedule of
courses each term and Campus Connection for listed offerings.

Definitions
Course descriptions frequently include additional information about enrollment. Students are responsible for complying with restrictions or
expectations related to course enrollment listed herein or in any supplementary information.

Course credits: Credits are stated in semester units as defined in the Academic Policies section in this bulletin.

Course prerequisites (Prereq): Prerequisites indicate the academic background, academic level, or other requirements considered necessary
for enrollment in the course. Most prerequisites are specific courses, however, equivalent preparation is usually acceptable.

Course co-requisites (Coreq): Co-requisites indicate courses to be taken concurrently with the course described. Instructor or department
permission may override a prerequisite or co-requisite.

Cross-listed courses: A cross-listed course means the same course is offered by two or more departments or under another course prefix.
Cross-listed courses are noted and the full description appears under the department responsible for the course. Credit may only be earned for
the course under one of the prefixes.

Dual-listed courses: Dual-listed courses with 400- or 500- and 600-level course numbers permit undergraduate and graduate students in the
same class. The same amount of credit for the course is earned by all students, but additional work is required of students enrolled under the
graduate level number. Credit may only be earned for the course at one of the levels.

Format of Course Listings
All university course offerings, listed alphabetically by areas of study, are described on the following pages. Course information and course
availability is subject to change. The heading, which precedes the brief description of each course, includes the current course number; course
title; and the number of semester credit hours, fixed or variable. Enrollment information, such as prerequisites and corequisites follows. The
frequency the course is offered may appear at the end of the description. F = Fall, S = Spring, SS = Summer Session. Terms presented in a
fraction indicate course is offered alternate years. F/2 = every other Fall semester.

COURSE NUMBERS
Course numbers indicate the student classification for which the course is primarily intended. Some course numbers end with a letter suffix:
L - laboratory course; R - recitation (undergraduate) or research continuation (graduate); S - graduate project. The number system is as
follows:
 • 100 series courses - open to freshmen¹
 • 200 series courses - primarily for sophomores
 • 300 series courses - primarily for juniors
 • 400 series courses - primarily for seniors
 • 500-599 series courses - post-baccalaureate professional courses
 • 600 numbered courses - Continuing Education post-baccalaureate courses, not applicable toward graduate degrees
 • 601-699 series courses - graduate courses taught concurrently in the same classroom with advanced undergraduates at the 400 or 500
   level
 • 700-799 series courses - open to graduate students

¹ Any 100-level course offered for non-degree credit is noted in the course description.

Notes: A bracketed course number or prefix [ ] indicates that the number or prefix of the same course has changed since the last publication
of the bulletin. Double credit cannot be earned by repeating a course unless the course description indicates otherwise.

Graduate standing is required for 600-700 level courses unless prior approval to use the course for an undergraduate program of study is
granted by the department/instructor.
